# Constraint Modelling in Curry

This project tries to model a high-level constraint language in Curry. The motivation for this abstraction origins in the paper ["Towards B as a High-Level Constraint Modelling Language Solving The Jobs Puzzle Challenge"](http://www.stups.uni-duesseldorf.de/mediawiki/images/4/45/Pub-LeuschelSchneider_ABZ14.pdf) by Michael Leuschel and David.
